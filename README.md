A browser based Mancala game which uses a Minimax algorithim to control the AI.

The underlying mechanics are ported from a Java based project I did for an AI class.

While there are many variations of this game, the objective is to get more marbles in your kalah (the pots at the ends of the board) than your opponent.
This is a turn-based game.  On their turn each player selects a pot.  The marbles in this pot are removed and deposited one at a time in the adjacent pots (moving counter-clockwise).  If a the last marble lands in an empty pot then the player captures (adds to their kalah) all of the opponents marbles from the pot directly opposite to the one landed in.

The game is over when all of one player's pots are empty.  Whoever has the most marbles in their kalah at the end wins.
